# Intro

I’ve been using open source and Linux on and off since the early 2000s. My first Linux distro was Caldera 2.4 an old RPM based that was cool in its hayday and then turned towards the dark side with various different lawsuits against Linux that never went anywhere.

I’ve been involved in more Linux Users Groups, mailing lists and conferences then I can count. I helped start a Linux conference that’s been running for a good while after I graduated educating and teaching people about the benefits of Linux and Open Source.

I'm a software engineering with a backend and big data focus.  I tend to prefer coding in Go and python these days though I've done Java for well over a decade now.  I love container technology, Kubernetes and always passionate about new tech and learning new skills.
